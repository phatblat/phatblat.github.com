## Kaiser Permanente Flagship 4.0
_Jul 2014_

In prep for increasing staff and development effort, it was decided to modularize the app on both platforms. I carved up the iOS app into 13 separate feature-based cocoapods, with 10 being runnable independently (the other 3 were shared libraries).

## Kaiser Permanente Flagship 3.0
_Jul 2013_

Almost a complete rewrite of the app (now 90% native) with a huge jump in visual and interaction design. Worked closely with a Denver-based development firm, mostly as a technical lead and release manager, but occasionally getting to write some code. Once our team took over the codebase, I immediately split the iOS and Android projects into distinct git repos (just a little filter-branch magic) to reduce the noise for both developers and our build server. Our team worked through many issues with untested portions of the code along with more than a few new features before release.

## KP Mobile 2.0
_Sep 2012_

Part native, part web. This version of the app introduced a native signon screen, but much of the app was either full web, or native screens backed by services which actually triggered web scraping as the main data source (that was fun to debug). The web scraping portions of the app were built by an outside agency. Near release I helped save the release due to many of the agency's other apps being rejected for not being "native enough" by embedding the KP Locator app into it.

## KP Mobile 1.0
_Jan 2012_

Few people know that Kaiser Permanente actually launched the Android version of their flagship app on Android first, before iOS. The initial release was a simple website wrapper; essentially just a web view. It was the first Android app I had ever worked on.

## KP Locator

Kaiser's first mobile app. I built a [delta service]({% post_url 2014-02-20-delta-service %})
